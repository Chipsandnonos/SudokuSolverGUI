# SudokuSolverGUI

#By Rahul Gudise

#All code is made by me, not taken from anywhere else

A Sudoku solver in which the user can input their own Sudoku board and watch as the computer solve the board

Description: Will solve Sudoku puzzles. To solve your own puzzle please open the gui in an ide and you can input your own sudoku board

The algorithm and how it works is explained in the final_algorithm.py file in the comments

This algorithm is not as optimized as many modern algorithms, however is still able to find solutions reasonably fast.

The algorithm is much slower due to the graphics updates, if you want a faster one, I have a console only version in another repository, where you just change
the board in the code (explained in that repository)
