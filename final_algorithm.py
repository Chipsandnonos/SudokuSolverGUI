#To improve, find the section which has the most, and use that as the starting part

#so to make better orient the sudoku in a favourable manner


#Sudoku Solver by Rahul.G
#This is a backtracking algorithm designed to solve sudoku puzzles
#All parts of the code were developed by me

#To input your own sudoku to be solved, scroll to the bottom of the code and input the values in the variable 'b'
#None spaces are places you need to figure out, soon I will develop a GUI version, until then hand input it by changing the code

#Before the algorithm begins, the program has to find the an optimal orientation of the board
#Sudoku boards are unique in that they can be flipped and be the same board
#However, due to the backtracking algorithm used it can make the time to solve the board drastically lower
#As seen with https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sudoku_puzzle_hard_for_brute_force.jpg , a board which using a typical backtracking algorithm would take a very long time to complete
#Thus what the program does is find the orientation of the board, which has the most given points near the start (top left corner) of the board
#This is done by finding which quadrant (1 is top left, 2 is top right, 3 is bottom left, 4 is bottom right), has the most given points
#This ensures that the board will have to test less possibilities, as it can get points with limited possibilities near the start of the board (algorithm goes left to right, top to bottom)
#Also if it is needed the board can also be mirrored if it makes more static points closer to the start

#Potential Improvements (Not to the algorithm, but the starting orientation code)
#A sudoku puzzle can be interpretted as a long integer, in which you are testing all of the combinations until one works out
#Thus not all positions are held equal, as is more or less assumed when counting given points in each quadrant, as all cells in a quadrant are considered to be worth the same amount
#However, points closer to the top left of a quandrant are significantly more important, this is not used in the program, but it can be potentially added to further enhance the efficiency of the program
#This was not implemented in this version, as the assumptions made still allow the algorithm to function very fast (even for the computationaly hard problem linked above)


#The Actual Algorithm and how it works
#The center of this backtracking algorithm is a recursive function which will be shown later

#How the Algorithm functions
# 1. It will first establish a possibility board, which in essence lists every possible number a space on the board can be
# 2. To make the code more efficient, the possibility board can be cleaned, this can be done by using the static cells
#    provided in the puzzle. Using these cells, several possibilities from the cells can be removed
# 3. The algorithm then starts at the first non static cell in the playing board, and extracts all of the cells possibilities from the possibility board, this list of
#    possibilities is referred to as the cache of possibilities for that iteration or frame of that function
# 4. The algorithm will pick the first entry in the cache (index 0), and add it to the board, this limits the possibilities for the rest of the board, as such the possibility board will be updated
# 5. This new board, and the possibility board are then sent as arguments for the next iteration for this recursive function
# 6. This will keep happening until a cell in the possibility board has no values left in its possibility cachel, ie. the combinations chosen have made solving the board impossible
#    when this occours the function returns false, and returns to the previous iteration. It will then try the next value in its possibility cache, repeating the same process as above
# 7. This continues until the board is solved
